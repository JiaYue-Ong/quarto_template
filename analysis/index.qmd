# Final Project: MUSA 5500 Geospatial Data Science in Python

This section contains my final project for MUSA 5500 Geospatial Data Science in Python. 

*Background:*
The United States of America (USA) is a large country comprising 50 states. Each state is not equal, and it would be interesting to analyse and map out the differences in level of development and socioeconomic indicators between each state as if they were 50 sovereign countries.

My final project's research question is inspired by Gapminder from the Clustering lecture. I aim to apply this in the context of US States to answer these questions: how do socioeconomic variables vary across US states and time? And do they suggest which states are more developed/deprived than others?

*Implication:*
